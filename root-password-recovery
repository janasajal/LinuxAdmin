Resetting root password by booting into Single User Mode
Step-1: Reboot your system and interrupt the 'GRUB 2' boot screen by hitting 'e' key.
## N.B.: Please do not select rescue mode. Select the grub which is used to load OS (Default one).
The kernel boot parameters appear. Find the word 'linux16' and add ‘rd.break’ at the end of the line, then press 'Ctrl+x' to boot the system with the changed parameters.

By default, the root filesystem will be mounted in RO mode.
To crosscheck
#mount | grep root ## this will show /sysroot filesystem was mounted as ro.
# mount -o remount,rw /sysroot
# chroot /sysroot
# passwd root
# touch /.autorelabel
