Edit the /etc/pam.d/password-auth and /etc/pam.d/system-auth files to include the appropriate options for pam_pwquality.so and to conform to site policy:

password requisite pam_pwquality.so try_first_pass retry=3

# vi /etc/pam.d/system-auth
password    requisite     pam_pwquality.so try_first_pass local_users_only retry=5 authtok_type=

##retry=5 --> number of retry to set passwd.
## local_users_only
On RedHat-based systems, password checks are enabled via configuration in the /etc/pam.d/system-auth and /etc/pam.d/password-auth files. Actually, these files are just symbolic links to /etc/pam.d/system-auth-ac and /etc/pam.d/password-auth-ac, respectively.

The default configuration looks like this:

password    requisite     pam_pwquality.so try_first_pass local_users_only retry=3 authtok_type=
password    sufficient    pam_unix.so sha512 shadow nullok try_first_pass use_authtok
The try_first_pass option tells a later module to try using the password entered for a previous module. In the configuration above, pam_pwquality will require the user to enter a strong password choice, and the try_first_pass option on pam_unix module tells pam_unix to try this choice. Similarly, use_authtok tells pam_unix to use the password from the stacked pam_pwquality module.

Frankly, the try_first_pass option is redundant with the use_authtok option on pam_unix. And try_first_pass isn't necessary for pam_pwquality since there are no modules stacked in front of it.

Other default options set on pam_pwquality above include local_users_only, which tells pam_pwquality to ignore users that are not in the local /etc/passwd file (for example, users whose accounts are in an LDAP or Active Directory database). The retry option is the number of tries a user gets to pick an acceptable password before the module returns an error.

By default, the prompt the user gets when entering their password is "New password:". If the administrator sets authtok_type=FOO, the prompt becomes "New FOO password:".

For pam_unix, the sha512 option means use a password hashing routine based on the SHA512 algorithm. blowfish is also supported along with several other, less secure, choices. The shadow option means maintain password hashes in a separate /etc/shadow file that is only readable by the root user. This option should always be set. nullok means allow user accounts that have null password entries. Personally, I would recommend removing this option.

Taking all of this advice together, a better default configuration for these modules would be:

password    requisite     pam_pwquality.so local_users_only retry=3
password    sufficient    pam_unix.so sha512 shadow use_authtok

How to count chars in password
Following is the pam_cracklib password credit calculation for a user password of “@1Bcdef2”:

@1Bcdef2: 8 credits awarded i.e. one for each character
@: 1 credit awarded (other)
1,2: 1 credit awarded (digit)
B: 1 credit awarded (upper)
cdef: 1 credit awarded (lower)
8 + 4 = 12 (minlen)
minlen	Password	Password Length (chars)	Credit	Password Accepted?
10	qwertasdf	9	9 (chars) + 1 (lower) = 10	Yes
12	qwertasdfgz	11	11 (chars) + 1 (lower) = 12	Yes
14	qwertasdfgzxc	13	13 (chars) + 1 (lower) = 14	Yes
14	qwertasdf1$	11	11 (chars) + 1 (lower) + 1 (digit) + 1 (other) = 14	Yes
10	qwertasd	8	8 (chars) + 1 (lower) =  9	No
12	qwertasdfg	10	10 (chars) + 1 (lower) = 11	No
14	qwertasdfgzx	12	12 (chars) + 1 (lower) = 13	No
