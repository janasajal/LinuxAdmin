Common Options:

async: Allows the server to respond to requests before changes are written to disk.
no_root_squash: Allows root on the client to have root privileges on the server.

[root@wbsedclsbipayment sbi-fileupload]# cat /etc/exports
/paymnt_BANK/paymnt-fileupload 10.251.xx.xx(ro,sync)
[root@wbsedclsbipayment sbi-fileupload]#

Sceanrio: 
If a ro shared file not accessible for read, then assign the uid & gid of the file to nfs client system user. To prevent it use all_squash.
